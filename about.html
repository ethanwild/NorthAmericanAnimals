	This is website about Nature in North America. It is a very basic and rather bland site.

		<strong>Project V1</strong> (4/22/2019) started with some links but without any other pages, so there was no navigation between them. There was a short text which briefly summarized the website's objective, but this was discarded in <strong>Project V2</strong>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Project V2 (5/1/2019) was a major improvement over V1, with images, working links, and added text across the different pages. It also had much more code in it, with some image hotspots, a box shadow, and many other small things. It also had CSS that effected the pages much more than in V1.
		</p>

		<p>
		In <strong>Project V3</strong> (5/18/2019), a table and media queries were added and some more pages as well. The about page was updated and some additional detail was put here and there. The background image, though seemingly more fitting than the new one, was changed because the previous one made it hard to see anything since it was so dark.
		</p>

		<p>
		<strong>Project V4</strong> was the final version. The media queries were removed and the new version included a form which was intended to help narrow down the search for specific plant-eating animals, and also a video was imbedded into one of the pages as well. An extra meta element was added to the home page and it was renamed with a more suitable title. There was no CSS that was applied to the form or to the video, but there was an extra outcome that was demonstrated in the form. Unfortunately, the three warnings on the table were never fixed, even though it had been intended to do so. Lastly, a box shadow was put on the home screen image for extra style. This box-shadow did not effect the other pages, however, as it was not applied to them. All CSS warnings were fixed as well.
