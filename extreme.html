<p>
	Extreme climate zones are the areas where the temprature is either abnormally high or low. In these parts of the Continent, most of the wildlife that lives here is better specifically for living in these extreme places. In Saudi Arabia, it is the warmest place in the world with hardly any water, whereas in the North Pole, even at midnight in the summer time the sun never completely dissapears below the horizon because of the position of the Earth. In the warmer places, water is hard to come by, and in the more chilling places, everything is pretty much frozen stiff. To survive under these conditions is not easy.
