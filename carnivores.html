	The <strong>Cheetah</strong> is a large cat that lives in Africa. It lives much like the Lion and the Leopard and hunts the same way as well. It is also the fastest animal in the world, second only to the Leopard Shark. 
	</p>
	<p>
	When looking at the animal, it is easy to guess that it was designed for speed. Its body is muscular but also slender, and its legs are good at making large strides and long jumps when it needs to run.
	</p>
		
As one can see by looking at the table below, the Cheetah is quite fast.
