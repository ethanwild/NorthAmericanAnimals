	The temperate climate takes up most of North America, as well as most of the entire world. Most living things things are stationed here, as the climate is much easier to get by in. The temprature is just all-around between too hot and too cold, so it is much easier to get used to conditions such as these. Most would consider it common sense to abstain from the harsh climates in the far corners of the world where hardly anything exists, so most life will be found in the temperate zones.
